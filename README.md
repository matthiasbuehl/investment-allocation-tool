# Investment Allocation Tool

This tool helps to determine how much money investors are allowed to contribute to a particular startup.

## Limitations to be addressed in future releases

1. No form validation.
2. The ui is fixed to 3 investors only. It should be possible to add any (reasonable) amount of investors.
3. Styling needs work!
